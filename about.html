        Hi! My name is Royce Navora I am an Illustrator and I am currently
        Studying Bachelor of Multimedia Arts at Lyceum of the Philippines
        University. I like to draw fan arts from my favorite Animes, Shows,
        Manga, and Games. I draw digitally, I use Adobe Photoshop to create my
        Arts I like to draw things, characters that I am a fan of, for now I
        Mostly focus on fan arts because I am still exploring on drawing
        Digitally since I just started to draw digitally since 2020. I mostly
        Draw traditionally but I started my journey on drawing digitally on
        December of the year 2020. Transitioning from traditional to digital is
        Hard like beginners mostly do, the illustrations that I did are not so
        Good but I started researching how to draw digitally I research the
        Methods on drawing digitally and I started practicing and made atleast
        One illustration a day the results are what my portfolio is now, I
        Improved a lot by practicing and drawing atleast one illustration a day
        And also reasearching proper methods in making digital illustrations.
        For now all my illustrations are fan arts of the shows, and games I
        Love, but in the future I would like to create my own concept and own
        Style of art and I also like to explore more ways to create digital art
        And I would also like to explore animation but for the mean time I will
        Focus on improving my illustration.
