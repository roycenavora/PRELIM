  <h5>HI! MY NAME IS ROYCE NAVORA I AM AN ILLUSTRATOR AND I AM CURRENTLY STUDYING 
    BACHELOR OF MULTIMEDIA ARTS AT LYCEUM OF THE PHILIPPINES UNIVERSITY. I LIKE TO DRAW FAN ARTS FROM MY 
FAVORITE ANIMES, SHOWS, MANGA, AND GAMES. I DRAW DIGITALLY, I USE ADOBE PHOTOSHOP TO CREATE MY ARTS I LIKE TO DRAW
THINGS, CHARACTERS THAT I AM A FAN OF, FOR NOW I MOSTLY FOCUS ON FAN ARTS BECAUSE I AM STILL EXPLORING ON DRAWING 
DIGITALLY SINCE I JUST STARTED TO DRAW DIGITALLY SINCE 2020. I MOSTLY DRAW TRADITIONALLY BUT I STARTED MY JOURNEY 
ON DRAWING DIGITALLY ON DECEMBER OF THE YEAR 2020. TRANSITIONING FROM TRADITIONAL TO DIGITAL IS HARD LIKE BEGINNERS MOSTLY 
 DO, THE ILLUSTRATIONS THAT I DID ARE NOT SO GOOD BUT I STARTED RESEARCHING HOW TO DRAW DIGITALLY I RESEARCH THE METHODS 
 ON DRAWING DIGITALLY AND I STARTED PRACTICING AND MADE ATLEAST ONE ILLUSTRATION A DAY THE 
RESULTS ARE WHAT MY PORTFOLIO IS NOW, I IMPROVED A LOT BY PRACTICING AND DRAWING ATLEAST ONE ILLUSTRATION A DAY AND 
ALSO REASEARCHING PROPER METHODS IN MAKING DIGITAL ILLUSTRATIONS. FOR NOW ALL MY ILLUSTRATIONS ARE FAN ARTS OF THE SHOWS, AND
GAMES I LOVE, BUT IN THE FUTURE I WOULD LIKE TO CREATE MY OWN CONCEPT AND OWN STYLE OF ART AND I ALSO LIKE TO EXPLORE MORE 
WAYS TO CREATE DIGITAL ART AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPLORE ANIMATION BUT FOR THE MEAN TIME I WILL FOCUS ON IMPROVING MY
ILLUSTRATION. </h5>
